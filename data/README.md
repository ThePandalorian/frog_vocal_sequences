seqdata_sil contains recordings converted into strings. In both species, '0' indicates silence. For Nyctibatrachus, 1 indicates an AN and 0 indicates a DN. For Pseudophilautus, numbers 1 through 6 indicate notetypes 1 through 6 respectively.

 alldata.csv is a mastersheet containing spectral and temporal data of manually annotated notetypes.

notetype_proportion_data.csv contains data on the proportion of each notetype emitted by each individual.

In the case of Nyctibatrachus, there is an additional file, prob_appending_DNs.csv, which contains data on the number of times an individual emitted various numbers of DNs.

the cullpdb FASTA file (cullpdb_pc20_res1.6_R0.25_d210225_chains3824.fasta) is publicly available amino acid sequence data that I used as a proof of concept for the co-occurrence analysis (see the associated Jupyter Notebook for details)
